Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my Points map for #30DayMapChallenge

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project and do something similar for yourself,
I have detailed the software I used and actions I performed in the sections below
that you can follow to re-create my product for your own travels.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

The data sources I acquired, initally layered in QGIS in following order:

1) Major Picket Line locations (.csv I created)
3) US Census Bureau 5m nation Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)
2) US Census Bureau 5m states Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)


1) Major Picket Line locations (.csv I created)
To acquire the data on 2023 labor strikes (up until end of October) and create my
.csv of picket line locations, I used the Cornell Labor Action Tracker website:
https://striketracker.ilr.cornell.edu/
After looking through the available data, I decided I would limit myself to "major"
strikes (in this case, strikes with 2000+ participants, which was the largest bracket
I could sort by based on number of participants via the labor tracker website) and
only the major picket line locations, since those were provided by the labor tracker
but not necessarily every location where workers on any given strike were on strike.
So to acquire my data I set the date parameters between 1/1/23 and 10/25/23 (latter
being day I created the final version of the map) and set number of participants to
2000+. I then went through all the data provided and in a .csv file in Libre Office
for each individual strike I determined the listed picket line locations and then
determined the latitude and longitude for those locations using Google geocoding API:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview
Once this .csv was complete I had latitude and longitude locations I could add in
as a layer in QGIS.

2) US Census Bureau 5m Nation Cartographic Boundary Shapefile
Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

3) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile
Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

Data Visualization
###########################################################

After loading the three data layers into QGIS, I performed following steps.

Set projection to ESRI:102009 (North_America_Lambert_Conformal_Conic)
Scale 1:20,000,000

Symbology:
Points: Size 2.0mm, fill: #e5b636, stroke: #555555, stroke width: 0.1mm
Nation: fill: transparent, stroke: #ffffff, stroke width: 0.1mm
States: fill: #f2f2f5, stroke: #878787, stroke width: 0.16mm

Exported as PDF from QGIS, copied data to new .ai file in Adobe Illustrator

In Illustrator I changed the fill for all states that had one or more strike locations
to color: #F2F2F5

I then moved any points slightly in areas that had several points (New York, Los Angeles)
to better see the points individually

Then added text. Text for naming strike name and dates were Open Sans, 7pt, color: #323232
Text for naming cities/metro areas was Open Sans, 5.5pt, color: #6E6E64

Added callouts and other text where appropriate
