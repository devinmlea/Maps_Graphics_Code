Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my lines map for #30DayMapChallenge

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project and do something similar for yourself,
I have detailed the software I used and actions I performed in the sections below
that you can follow to re-create my product for your own travels.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

The data sources I acquired, initally layered in QGIS in following order:

1) Proposed New Border Walls (.shp I digitized from another source)
2) Existing Border Wall Segments (.gdb file)
3) Texas Major Rivers (.shp file)
4) Texas Reservoirs (.shp file)
5) Texas places (.shp file)
6) Mexico cities (.shp I digitized from another source)
7) Rio Grande Wildlife Areas (.gdb file)
8) 1 to 5 mil US counties (.shp file)
9) 1 to 10 mil land (.shp)
10) 1 to 10 mil ocean (.shp)

1) Proposed New Border Walls (.shp I digitized from another source)
I created a new layer in QGIS and digitized walls layer matching map shown on a social
media post by New York Times on October 6, 2023:

2) Existing Border Wall Segments (.gdb file)
.gdb data acquired from here:
https://data.world/inewsource/us-mexico-border-fencing-shapefiles

3) Texas Major Rivers (.shp file)
Acquired here: https://www.twdb.texas.gov/mapping/gisdata.asp

4) Texas Reservoirs (.shp file)
Acquired here: https://www.twdb.texas.gov/mapping/gisdata.asp

5) Texas places
Acquired from US Census Bureau: https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php
Layer Type: Places
State: Texas

6) Mexico cities:
I created a new layer in QGIS and digitized city boundaries by using Google Maps and
tracing estimated extents in QGIS

7) Land and Water Resources Conservation and Recreation Plan Statewide 2012 (.gdb file)
https://tpwd.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ec4e6d378ba14779b5d569c27f1236de

8) US Census Bureau 5m Counties Cartographic Boundary Shapefile
Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

9) Natural Earth Data 1:10m land
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/
Download Land

10) Natural Earth Data 1:10m ocean

Data Visualization
###########################################################

After loading files into GIS and digitizing layers I needed, I performed following steps.

Rotate to -40 from north setting, scale 1:600000

From the Land and Water Resources Conservation and Recreation Plan (LWRCRP) Statewide 2012,
I selected all state and federally managed lands in near the lower Rio Grande region and saved
them the selection into a new layer I named Selected_RioGrande_WildlifeAreas

Color for layers (layers top to bottom):
Proposed Border Wall: width 1.00mm, color: #ff0029
Existing Border Wall: width 1.00mm, color: #000000
Texas Counties1: fill color: transparent, stroke color: #b3b3b3, stroke width: 0.1mm, dash line
Rivers: width 1.00mm, color: #c5ddf4
Reservoirs: fill color: #c5ddf4, stroke color: #b4d6df, stroke width: 0.2mm
Texas Places: fill color: #fafafa, no stroke
Mexico Cities: fill color: #fafafa, no stroke
Selected_RioGrande_WildlifeAreas: fill color: #adbfb7
Texas Counties2: fill color: #f1f1f5
Land: fill color: #e8e8ec
Ocean: fill color: #c5ddf4

I then exported the map from QGIS as a .PDF and copied the data from the .PDF to a new .ai
file in Adobe Illustrator

In Adobe Illustrator I added text and labels. The longer text describing the situation was
informed by the following articles:
https://truthout.org/articles/biden-administration-waives-26-laws-to-speed-construction-on-trumps-border-wall/
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/us/border-wall-biden-texas-starr-county.html

Font used was Open Sans

To create the inset map I used 1:5m states cartographic boundary file in QGIS and selected Texas and saved
it as its own layer. Then set it as color #8c8c91 and exported as PDF and copied into map in Illustrator.
