Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my North America map for #30DayMapChallenge

I wanted to look across North America at where there are recognized
holidays for Indigenous peoples and what those holidays entail

I have detailed the software I used and actions I performed in the sections below
that you can follow to re-create my product for your own travels.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

I acquired the following data sources:

1) 1:50m countries (.shp)
2) 1:50m states/provinces (.shp)
3) 1:50m lakes (.shp)
4) Countries and states holidays honoring indigenous people data (various websites)

1) 1:50m countries
Obtained from:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/
Admin 0 - Countries

2) 1:50m states/provinces (.shp)
Obtained from:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/
Admin 1 - states, provinces

3) 1:50m lakes (.shp)
Obtained from:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/
Lakes + Reservoirs

4) Countries and states holidays honoring indigenous people data (various websites)
I collected information for all countries considered in North America by Wikipedia,
as well as for U.S. states (minus Hawai'i). The information I collected and sorted
in a .csv file.

Data Visualization
###########################################################

After loading files 1-3 into QGIS I performed following steps.

Set Projection to ESRI:102009 (North_America_Lambert_Conformal_Conic)

I selected countries not in North America from the countries layer and saved the selection
as its own new shapefile named SelectCountriesNotNorthAmerica. From the countries that were in North
America from the countries shapefile I selected countries that have a holiday honoring indigenous\
peoples and saved that selection as its own file named CountriesIndigenousDay

For the states/provinces file I selected U.S. States and saved them as their own shapefile
named US_States. From US_States I selected states that have a designated holiday and saved to new
shapefile named DesignatedHoliday. I also selected states that have had only a governor decree,
and saved to new file named GovernorDecree.

From the lakes shapefile, I selected the Great Lakes between US/Canada, Great Salt Lake and Lago
de Nicaragua and saved selection to new shapefile called SelectedLakes.

I then displayed the following layers and set symbology as so:
Selected Lakes: fill color: #ffffff, no stroke
DesignatedHoliday: fill color: #82779c, stroke: #ffffff, stroke width: 0.2mm
GovernorDecree: fill style: BDiagonal, fill color: #b4adc7, stroke: #ffffff, stroke width: 0.2mm
US_States: fill color: #dedbe7, stroke: #ffffff, stroke width: 0.2mm
CountriesIndigenousDay: fill color: #82779c, stroke: #ffffff, stroke width: 0.2mm
SelectCountriesNotNorthAmerica: fill color: #f5f5f5, stroke: #ffffff, stroke width: 0.2mm
1:50m countries: fill color: #dedbe7, stroke: #ffffff, stroke width: 0.2mm

I then exported the map as PDF and copied map data to new file in Adobe Illustrator

I illustrator I added the text. Font was Open Sans
