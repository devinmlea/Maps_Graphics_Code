Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to make this for my Weather/Climate entry for Map Prompt
Monday week 6 2023

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were two data sources I acquired:
1) NOAA GFS analysis data (grib2)
2) Natural Earth Data 1:50m countries polygons (shapefile)


1) NOAA GFS analysis data (grib2)

Obtained analysis data from the NOAA global forcast system (0.5 degree) on
2/5/2023. I obtained file name gfs_4_20230203_0600_000, meaning the analysis
data was from 0600 UTC time, which is around early to mid afternoon in
Australia.

2) Natural Earth Data 1:50m countries polygons (shapefile)
Obtained from this link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/


I also used the following news article as a reference when producing my map and to add my
text describing the weather on 2/3/2023 across Australia:

Data Visualization

To begin, opened QGIS and used Globe Builder plugin to add a globe earth to a new map

Parameters used:
Countries 110m, graticules 20
Set center of globe coordinates to '132,-30' (Long,Lat)
Visualization
Background: #f7f2eb
Globe layout background: #ffffff
countries: opacity = 0%
graticules: #f6f6f7, opacity 50%
halo: #f7f2eb

I then added the NOAA GFS grib2 data, then changed to show Apparent Temperature
under the source tab of Properties. Then changed the color ramp to PuOr
(Purple-Orange) and inverted the color ramp in symbology. Set the min to -40
and max to 40 celcius, and altered the breaks of the color ramp so that the
'neutral' gray color was about 10C. I wanted this shifted to about 10C rather
than 0C for a few reasons. One, it showed the cooler temperatures in southeast
Australia I wanted to highlight much better than if break point was at 0C.
Second, being summer, 10C and cooler seems anomylously cool for a high temp,
so it seemed appropriate to depict temps below 10c as light purple.

Added the 1:50m countries shapefile and made fill color transparent and stroke
color was #232323 (R,G,B all 35) with stroke width 0.16 to give countries a
light black outline to better show there locations with the weather data


I then exported this map from QGIS as a PDF at 200dpi and opened and copied the data
to a new .ai file in Adobe Illustrator.

Once in Illustrator, one of the main tasks I completed was creating clipping masks
so that land was displayed above graticule lines. To do this, I created copies
of the NOAA GFS data and the land outlines and put the copies in the same x,y
locations and then created a clipping mask using the copies so that the new
layer was shown above the graticule lines. I did this for all the significantly
large land masses where you could see graticule lines originally across the land

Another issue I had to address was that since I used the globe builder with the
NOAA GFS data, there was a data seem running along 180 longitude. To correct this
I used the rectangle tool to create rectangles to fill in the 'missing' pixels
and then I used the eyedropper tool to make the color of the rectangles match
the color of the weather data immediately around them so they filled the seem.
I then had to make sure these data were shown below the graticule lines so the
180 longitude line could be seen.

I then took a screenshot of the color ramp in QGIS and copied the image into
my .ai file and sized it appropriately. 

Since I wanted a landscape orientation, I decided to cut off some of the top of the
globe and to fade this at the top. To do so I created a rectangle with the background
color (#ede8e1) and added feather effect with a radius of 30 and placed the rectangle
at the top of the map to create the fade effect

I also added a shadow to the globe by using the ellipse tool to create a circle fit
to the outer edge of the globe and then setting stroke = 13 and using feather effect
with radius of 12. Color was #58595b

Finally added all relevant text and symbols and arrows. Most of the descriptive black text
was font Gadugi, the capitalized Australia in white across the continent was
Times New Roman.
