TL;DR version: I generally followed the steps on this tutorial:

NOTE: you will need to create a free acount on OpenTopography.org and
request a free API key to be able to get the SRTM data to load.

Project Goal
###########################################################

The primary goal was to make a map for the Topography Map Prompt Monday
prompt. I initially tried to create a different 3D map in QGIS but
it was not working out, so I used the opportunity to try to create my
first map using Blender.

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.


###########################################################
Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

For this map I used Google Earth satellite data and the elevation data was from
NASA SRTM. Both of these are accessible directly in Blender after you download
and load in the BlenderGIS plugin

I will explain steps I used to create the map in next section

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To create my map, I generally followed along with a number of the steps
in the walkthrough of the video at the link here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj7Z1P2hUWk

I didn't have Blender on my computer before completing this map, so I first
downloaded Blender 3.5 software. I also downloaded the BlenderGIS plugin
from GitHub at this link:
https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS

After opening Blender and loading the plugins as discussed in the video,
I added Google Earth satellite imagery and went zoom level 11 and centered
on Mount Rainier before using 'e' button to set my scene. Then used SRTM
30m data to add topography.
NOTE: you will need to create a free acount on OpenTopography.org and
request a free API key to be able to get the SRTM data to load.

I then followed some of the same steps in the video to edit the visual texture
and look of the landscape to make it look more realistic.

After this I found the view angle I liked and exported an image of my view
from Blender.

I opened the exported image then in Adobe Illustrator and added appropriate text
labels of rivers and glaciers to the map.
