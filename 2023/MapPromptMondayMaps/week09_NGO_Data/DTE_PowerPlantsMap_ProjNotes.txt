Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to create a map using NGO data for Map Prompt Monday.
I also wanted to look at power sources for thinking about transitions
to cleaner and renewable energy sources

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were three data sources I acquired:
1) Global Energy Monitor Power Sources Data (.csv I created)
2) DTE Energy electricity service area polygon (.shp I created)
3) 1:10m lakes + reservoirs from Natural Earth Data (.shp)


1) Global Energy Monitor Power Sources Data (.csv I created)

Knowing the DTE Energy electricity service area (see #2), I used the Global
Energy Monitor website (https://globalenergymonitor.org/) and the links to
the Coal Plant, Gas Plant, Nuclear Power, Wind Power, and Solar Power trackers
to find all energy sources that produced greater than 20MWs. These I recorded
in a .csv file. Specifically, I recorded the following information:
Name - what was name of the power source
Type - type of power source (gas, coal, ...)
Mws - number of Megawatts produced
BeginYr -  what year did the source start operation
Owner - who owns/operates the power source
Lat - latitude value
Long - longitude value

2) DTE Energy electricity service area polygon (.shp I created)

I created the approximate area of the DTE Energy electricity service area by
drawing a polygon boundary. Specifically, I used a polygon of Michigan to start
and then traced approximate boundaries of the DTE service area using images I
found of the area, such as the one at this link:
https://www.dteenergy.com/us/en/residential/service-request/moving/service-area-map.html


3) 1:10m lakes + reservoirs from Natural Earth Data (.shp)

Downloaded data from link:

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and loaded in the two data layers I had and
created the DTE energy electricity service area polygon

Lakes layer color set to #dcf3fb
DTE coverage area polygon set to #114a8d, 20% opacity

I wanted to make the power source size related to Megawatt production
and the color based on the type of power source. To do this, for the
Global Energy Monitor Power Sources Data I changed the symbology type
to Categorized and the value to MWs, and then I manually set the size
of the circle for each power source proportional to its MWs (25mm for
largest, down to 2mm for smallest). I also set the colors for each power
source type. The color hex values for each type were as follows:
Coal: #555555
Natural Gas: #cc3311
Nuclear: #ee3377
Wind: #009988
Solar: #ee7733
The colors came from Figure 3 of the Qualitative Color Schemes section here:
https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/
All circles set to 90% opacity
For power sources not owned by DTE, the circles had no fill color and the stroke
color was matched to its power source, stroke width was 0.4.

Exported this map at 1:1,900,000 as a PDF

Opened Adobe Illustrator and created new .ai file, opened PDF and copied map data
to the .ai file. Then added various text and labels. The DTE Energy vs. Regional
Average Fuel Mix data came from DTE Energy, link here:
https://www.dteenergy.com/us/en/residential/community-and-news/environment/fuel-mix.html

Data about the Monroe Power Plant was found on the Global Energy Monitor Wiki page here:
