Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to create a map for the favorite animal prompt
for Map Prompt Monday.

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were four data sources I acquired:
1) Habitat extent from IUCN Red List (.shp)
2) Natural Earth Data 1:50m Land polygons (.shp)
3) Natural Earth Data 1:50m Shaded Relief (GeoTiff)
4) Puma images (Wikimedia commons)


1) Puma habitat extent from IUCN Red List (.shp)

To acquire habitat extent for Puma concolor, I logged onto my account on the IUCN
Red List Website: https://www.iucnredlist.org/ (You can register for a free account
if you don't already have one). I then searched for Puma and went to the species page,
where from Download tab I selected "Range Data - Polygons (SHP)".

2) Natural Earth Data 1:50m Land polygons (.shp)

Downloaded here:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/

3) Natural Earth Data 1:50m Shaded Relief (GeoTiff)
Downloaded here:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-raster-data/

4) Puma images (Wikimedia commons)
I acquired two images of Pumas from Wikimedia Commons:
a) https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Puma_concolor_stanleyana_-_Texas_Park_-_Lanzarote_-PC08_(cropped).jpg
b) https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Puma_face.jpg

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and loaded in the three data layers in order:
Puma habitat (top)
Land polys (middle)
Shaded Relief (bottom)

The main challenge for this map was that I wanted a projected coordinate
system focused on both North and South America, but there are not really
any pre-set ones that I liked. So I created a user-defined projection
with the following parameters:
Proj4 string:
+proj=aeqd +lat_0=5 +lon_0=-77.78 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +type=crs
In other words, I created a equidistant projection with center latitude at 5 deg N and center
longitude at 77.78 deg west. I used the Projection Wizard web tool to easily set the area
I wanted to cover and then just copied the PROJ string right into the unique coordiate
system parameters.
Projection Wizard Tool can be found at: https://projectionwizard.org/

Set land polygons color as #d1baa7 and opacity to 45%
Shaded relief opacity set to 80%

For Puma Habitat, I categorized the data using Value = PRESENCE under
the Symbology section. There were 2 data categories (1 = extant,
3 = possibly extant). I set color of 1 = #503d2f and 60% opacity.
I set color of 3 = #987356 and 65% opacity.

I then exported the map as a PDF at 1:70,000,000 scale


After acquiring the Puma images I wanted from Wikimedia Commons, I opened them in Adobe
Photoshop and used the Select and Mask Tool to select the part of the image I wanted to
keep (the Pumas) and make the background transparent. Then I exported these as PNG files
to keep the transparency.

I then created a new Adobe Illustrator file and copied the map data and the edited
Puma images into the .ai file. Then added relevant text, text font was Impact.
