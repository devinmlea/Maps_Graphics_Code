Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to create a map of a recent disaster for the weekly
Map Prompt Monday topic. I had seen news coverage but not much of any
mapping done for the recent Pajaro River flood in early March.

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep + Data Visualization
###########################################################


This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

The seven data sources I acquired:
1) Evacuation zone area and levee breach location (The Mercury News map)
2) California incorporated places (US Census Bureau)
3) California roads (US Census Bureau)
4) LiDAR data for hillshade (USGS)
5) California state polygon for inset map (US Census Bureau)
6) California hydrography data (Cal Dept. of Fish and Wildlife)
7) California highway sign (Wikimedia Commons)


1) Evacuation zone area and levee breach location (The Mercury News map)
I used a map that can be found at this link: 
https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/03/11/levee-breaches-on-pajaro-river-in-monterey-county-prompting-evacuations-and-rescues/
The map I found and could view by Google Search "pajaro river levee map". The map
showed evacuation area and where the levee breach were located. I used this map and digitized
an approximate area of the flood from the evacuation area and based on the hillshade I derived
from the USGS LiDAR data.

2) California incorporated places (US Census Bureau)
Went to this link to acquire data:
https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php
On the menu selected year 2022 and layer type was Places, then selected California shapefile to download

3) California roads (US Census Bureau)
Went to this link to acquire data:
https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php
On the menu selected year 2022 and layer type was Roads
Then selected state of California under "All Roads"
I then selected Monterey County and Santa Cruz county and downloaded roads shapefiles

4) LiDAR data for hillshade (USGS)
Downloaded data from USGS 3DEP LidarExplorer:
https://apps.nationalmap.gov/lidar-explorer/#/
I generally followed the steps of the Daniel Coe tutorial below. I found 1 meter Lidar
DEMs that covered the area I wanted to map around the mouth of the Pajaro River and downloaded
them and them used merge to combine them into a single DEM which I used for my hillshade.

5) California state polygon for inset map (US Census Bureau)
Used US States 1:5m Cartographic Boundary File (shapefile)
Obtained "cb_2018_us_state_5m" from US Census Bureau at this link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
Then in QGIS I selected California and saved it to its own shapefile

6) California hydrography (shapefile)
Downloaded hydrography shapefile from:
https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/CalEMA::california-river-and-stream-hydrography/about
After downloading, I opened file in QGIS and selected the Pajaro river and saved the
selection to its own shapefile

Data Visualization
###########################################################

Note: general style of map I was trying to emulate for this map was 
future flood extent maps from New York Times as seen here:
https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/24/opinion/sunday/what-could-disappear.html

To begin, opened QGIS and loaded in all the files

After creating my single DEM for the project area, I changed the DEM to a hillshade
under Properties -> Symbology -> Render Type. Altitude was set to 20 degrees, z factor
set to 1.5. I changed transparency to 30%.

I then selected out the Pajaro river polyline from the California hydrography dataset and
digitized the approximate flooded area as described in the section above.

The pajaro river polyline I set color as #588fbc, width 1.0 mm.
The flood extent area color was #588fbc, opacity 40%.

From the California places shapefile I selected the community extent of Pajaro and saved
the selection to its own shapefile. I then removed all places except Pajaro and for the
Pajaro extent shapefile changed color to #c9be61 and opacity to 30%.

For the Santa Cruz County and Monterey county roads layers I went to Symbology and changed
from Single Symbol to Categorized. For Value I categorized by "MTFCC". For more information
on what these codes mean, see link:
https://sites.google.com/site/geospatialmaps/resources/mtfcc-code/cfcc-codes
For my purposes, here are setting I used for the various codes:
S1100 - color: #808080, width 0.5mm
S1200 - color: #8c8c8c, width 0.3mm
S1400 - color: #999999, width 0.1mm
S1630 - color: #999999, width 0.1mm
Everything else was changed to transparent so to remove them from view

I then exported the map from QGIS as a PDF at 1:55000 scale and 200dpi.
I opened a new Adobe Illustrator file and copied the data from the PDF to the new file.

To add the California highway signs on the appropriate highways, I first opened the
downloaded image file from Wikimedia Commons in paint and removed the text by making
the text "California" and "1" white to match interior color of the sign. I then saved
this edit and opened the edited image in Adobe Photoshop and used the Select and Mask
tool to only select the interior white and the first black boundary while rest of the
sign and background was made transparent. I saved this edited image as a PNG from
Photoshop and then opened and copied and scaled the image in my Illustrator file.

All the text I added in Illustrator was the Open Sans Font from Google that is free
to download at this link: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans

To create the inset map in QGIS I used the California extent polygon and changed it
using symbology to: 
fill color: #efeff2
stroke color: #ffffff, stroke width: 0.3 mm
I then zoomed to extent where Bay Area and Monterey Bay could be seen and exported as
a PDF, which I then opened and copied to my Illustrator file. I created a rectangle
in illustrator that covered size and extent of the inset map area I wanted and created
a clipping mask to frame the data to that rectangle that had no fill and white stroke.

The callouts on the map for "Flooded Areas" and "Levee Breach" were created using the
Rectangle and Polygon tools. Color was 231f20, text was white color.
