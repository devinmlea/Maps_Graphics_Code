Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to make this for my Safety entry for Map Prompt
Monday week 23 2023


###########################################################
Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were four data sources I acquired:
1) Natural Earth Data 1:10m lakes polygons (shapefile)
2) Natural Earth Data 1:10m states/provinces (shapefile)
3) National Safety Council Logo (image)
4) Sites of 2022 fatal boating accidents in Michigan (from uscgboating.org/)

1) Natural Earth Data 1:10m lakes polygons (shapefile)

2) Natural Earth Data 1:10m states/provinces (shapefile)

3) Acqired and saved copy of image found here:

4)  Sites of 2022 fatal boating accidents in Michigan (from uscgboating.org/)
Information on 2022 Recreational Boating Statistics Here
https://www.uscgboating.org/library/accident-statistics/Recreational-Boating-Statistics-2022.pdf
For my map I put points once I was in Adobe Illustrator to best match what is seen in 
Figure 12a on page 59
I also used data from this document and the 2020 Recreational Boating statistics:
https://www.uscgboating.org/library/accident-statistics/Recreational-Boating-Statistics-2020.pdf
together to create the boating accidents and deaths chart. For both the 2020 and 2022 pdfs the
fatality data by state is on page 63.

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and added natural earth data layers

I first selected Michigan polygon from the states/provinces layer and saved the selection
to a new layer. For the new Michigan layer polygon I set symbology as:
fill color: #ebebf8
stroke color: #232323
Stroke width: 0.06mm

Then from the lakes layer I selected the polygons covering the five great lakes and saved
the selection to a new layer. I then used dissolve tool to dissolve the polygons into
a single polygon.

I then used the buffer tool five separate times to create internal buffers of the dissolved
lakes layer and get the water lines effect.
I used values of -0.02, -0.05, -0.09, -0.15, and -0.22 degrees

I then used following colors for the original lake layers and buffers:
Original: R:37,G:113,B:175
B1 (-0.02): R:64,G:144,B:197
B2 (-0.05): R:107,G:172,B:212
B3 (-0.09): R:157,G:202,B:225
B4 (-0.15): R:198,G:219,B:240
B5 (-0.22): R:223,G:235,B:247

I then exported the map as PDF and opened and copied to new .ai file in Adobe Illustrator

I used circle tool to put points on the 2022 fatal boat accidents locations, based on points
seen from 2022 Recreational Boating Statistics, Figure 12a on page 59
Color: 1e1e1e

Added National Safety Council Logo and text
Title text is Impact font, other text around map was Frutiger Bold. Text on graph was Open Sans.

I created the graph in LibreOffice and then copied it to Adobe Illustrator
Changed accidents color to #004586
Deaths line/text color was #1e1e1e
