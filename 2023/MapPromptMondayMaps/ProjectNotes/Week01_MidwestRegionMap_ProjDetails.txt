Project Goal
###########################################################

First goal was to make map for 2023 week 1 Region(s) for
#MapPromptMonday

I also wanted to make a map that would help me investigate
the complexities of defining regions, and doing it for the
United States region I grew up in and recently returned to
felt like a fun challenge

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were several data sources I acquired:
1) US Census Bureau states (shapefile)
2) US Census Bureau counties (shapefile)
3) Dialect Regions (shapefile I created)
4) USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Corn and Soybeans bushels by US county (csv I created)
5) US Physiographic Data (shapefile)
6) YouGov Where is the Midwest survey data 






1) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

I obtained 1:5m Cartographic Boundary Shapefile of state polygons from
US Census Bureau at:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS


2) US Census Bureau 5m Counties Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS


3) Dialect Regions (shapefile I created)

Map from Rick Aschmann at:
https://aschmann.net/AmEng/
I used this map to digitize a polygon of what I defined as the Midwest
Dialect Region


4) USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Corn and Soybeans bushels by US county (csv I created)

Acquired the data from:
https://www.nass.usda.gov/Quick_Stats/Lite/index.php

Selections
Sector -> CROPS
Group -> FIELD CROPS
Commodity -> CORN OR SOYBEANS
View -> Acreage, Yield, Production and Price
Year -> 2021
Geographic Level -> COUNTY
Choose each state, then copy data to csv files

I created one csv with all states for Corn and a second for Soybeans


5) US Physiographic Data (shapefile)

Downloaded data from:
https://water.usgs.gov/GIS/metadata/usgswrd/XML/physio.xml#stdorder


6) YouGov Where is the Midwest survey data 

Data from https://today.yougov.com/topics/society/articles-reports/2022/08/31/drawing-midwest-map-what-states-americans-think
I used the last main graph percentage numbers of Midwesterners

Data Visualization
###########################################################

The final map was made up of six primary data layers:
1) US Census Defined Midwest Region states
2) Midwest Dialect Region
3) Corn Harvest in Bushels by US County (2021)
4) Soybean Harvest in Bushels by US County (2021)
5) Interior Plains physiographic region
6) Self-Defined by People claiming to live in the Midwest

Most of the work was done in Microsoft Excel and QGIS, with just
a few final details added in Adobe Illustrator at the end

The coloring for each layer if defined in Midwest was based on the
color #bf31bf, then set to varying weighted opacity. The maximum
opacity for each layer is as follows:
Census Region = 15% for in, 0% for out
Dialect Region = 20% for in, 0% for out
Corn Harvest - set by bushels value, see section
Soybean Harvest - set by bushels value, see section
Interior Plains = 15% for in, 0% for out
Self-Defined -  set by value, see section

Background color for states not in Midwest for each layer was #ebebeb


Here is how I prepared each layer:

1) US Census Bureau states in Midwest Region

I opened the US Census Bureau state layer in QGIS, and I selected
all states defined to be in the Midwest Region by US Census Bureau
and then saved them to their own layer. These states were:
Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa,
Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas.

2) Midwest Dialect Region

I used the dialects map from Rick Aschmann at:
https://aschmann.net/AmEng/
as a guide, and I digitized an polygon that encompassed North Central,
The North, and West Midlands, Central Midlands and Allegheny Midlands
(but not East Midlands)

3) Corn Harvest in Bushels by US County (2021)

I first had to create new columns for State and County names to their
own separate columns using following criteria:
To Get County Name
=RIGHT(B2,(LEN(B2)-SEARCH(",",B2,SEARCH(",",B2)+1)-1))
To Get State Name
=LEFT(B2,SEARCH(",",B2)-1)

I used this to then determine FIPS codes for each county and these
were added to a new column

I took the csv of Corn Harvest data by US county I created and brought
it in to QGIS along with the US Census Bureau counties shapefile, joining
the data together by FIPS code and displaying the data in graduated symbols
by number of bushels of corn. The divisions were as follows:
5 million bushels or less (background color)
5-10 million bushels (3% opacity)
10-15 million bushels (9% opacity)
15-20 million bushels (12% opacity)
20 milion bushels or more (15% opacity)

4) Soybean Harvest in Bushels by US County (2021)

I first had to create new columns for State and County names to their
own separate columns using following criteria:
To Get County Name
=RIGHT(B2,(LEN(B2)-SEARCH(",",B2,SEARCH(",",B2)+1)-1))
To Get State Name
=LEFT(B2,SEARCH(",",B2)-1)

I used this to then determine FIPS codes for each county and these
were added to a new column

I took the csv of Corn Harvest data by US county I created and brought
it in to QGIS along with the US Census Bureau counties shapefile, joining

5 million bushels or less (background color)
5-10 million bushels (5% opacity)
10-15 million bushels (10% opacity)
15 milion bushels or more (15% opacity)

5) Interior Plains physiographic region

After opening the layer in QGIS, I used select by attributes to select
"DIVISION" = 'INTERIOR PLAINS' and saved selected polygons to new
layer

6) Self-Defined by People claiming to live in the Midwest
Opened a new US Census Bureau state polygon layer and used the percentage
of people who identified themselves as Midwesterners who said a state was
in the Midwest. For example, the highest score was 81% for Illinos, lowest
was 24% for Pennsylvania.

I set the layer so the color of each state could be set individually. All non-
Midwest states had same background color, all states in the survey were given
the standard color, then percent opacity was set based on scaling of scoring
below. (For example, Illinois was 20% opacity, Pennsylvania 1% opacity)

81 (round to 80) = 20%
77 = 19%
74 = 18%
71 = 17%
68 = 16%
65 = 15%
62 = 14%
59 = 13%
56 = 12%
53 = 11%
50 = 10%
47 = 9%
44 = 8%
41 = 7%
38 = 6%
35 = 5%
32 = 4%
29 = 3%
26 = 2%
23 = 1%


With all layers displayed together I then exported as PDF and opened the
PDF in Adobe Illustrator, where I added the key and text
