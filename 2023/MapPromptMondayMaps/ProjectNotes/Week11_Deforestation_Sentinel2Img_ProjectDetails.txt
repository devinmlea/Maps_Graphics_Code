Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to create a map using satellite image for Map Prompt Monday,
and specifically I wanted to try to learn how to access and use data
from the Sentinel-2 Satellite

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep + Data Visualization
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

The two main data sources I acquired:
1) Satellite Image of Sangha Region, Republic of Congo (Sentinel-2 image)
2) Globe Builder Plugin to create Globe for inset map (QGIS Plugin)


This project was inspired by the following article on Mongabay:

In first trying to acquire an appropriate satellite image for the study area,
I created an account so I could access Sentinel-2 images. To do this, I went to 
the following link:
https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home
On this website I created a new account so I could login and access images. I initially tried
to find and download the Sentinel-2 images via this interface, but I found it difficult to
bring the images into QGIS.

Due to this, I found that there was a QGIS Plugin called Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin
where you can access and download Sentinel-2 images directly in QGIS. After installing the
Plugin, I generally followed the steps described in the following tutorial to acquire an image
for my area of interest:

The image I used was taken on 12/26/2022 (RT_T33NWB_A039229_20221226T092620)
I downloaded several bands, but ended up sticking with R,G,B (true color) for my display.

Due to the clouds and/or atmospheric correction the reservoir in my image was much lighter
color than I wanted, so I made the true color image 70% opacity with the infared layer behind
it to darken the color of the water a bit.

I then exported the image from QGIS at 1:260000, 200 dpi.

I opened the image in Adobe Photoshop and increased brightness (+25) and contrast (+10) and
saved the aerial image. I then opened Adobe Illustrator and copied the edited image from
Adobe Photoshop into a new .ai file.

In Adobe Illustrator I then added appropriate text.

To get the inset map globe for my map, I opened a new QGIS file and used the Globe Builder
Plugin in QGIS to create a globe with gray countries and no graticule and white background.
I exported the globe as an image and opened and copied and scaled the image in my map.
