Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to make this for my Flow Map entry for Map Prompt
Monday week 5 2023

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were six data sources I acquired:
1) Base Flow data of Michigan streams (geopackage)
2) Natural Earth 10m land shapefile (shapefile)
3) Natural Earth 10m lakes shapefile (shapefile)
4) Natural Earth 10m Admin 1 – States, Provinces (shapefile)
5) Natural Earth 10m Shaded Relief, Large size (shapefile)
6) Michigan Lake Polygons (shapefile)


1) Base Flow data of Michigan streams (geopackage)

Downloaded geopackage data from here:
https://gis-egle.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/egle::base-flow-of-michigan-streams/about


2) Natural Earth 10m land shapefile (shapefile)

Downloaded shapefile from here:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/


3) Natural Earth 10m lakes shapefile (shapefile)

Downloaded shapefile from here:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/


4) Natural Earth 10m Admin 1 – States, Provinces (shapefile)

Downloaded shapefile from here:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/


5) Natural Earth 10m Shaded Relief, Large size (shapefile)

Downloaded shapefile from here:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-raster-data/10m-shaded-relief/


6) Michigan Lake Polygons (shapefile)

Polygons of smaller michigan lakes. Downloaded from Michigan GIS Open Data here:
https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/lake-polygons/explore?location=44.883491%2C-86.417800%2C7.60

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and loaded in all the files

I first used selection tool to select only the Michigan state shapefile from
the States and Provinces layer, and used save selected features to new
layer to create a new shapefile layer of the Michigan state polygon
Then changed its color to #D7D7EB and 50% opacity

For the rivers base flow data, I used select by attributes and selected rivers where
base flow exceeded 100 cfs and saved the selected features to a new shapefile
and displayed only rivers with base flow > 100 cfs

For Michigan lake polygons layer, I used select by attribute to select lakes
that were greater than 500 hectares and then saved the selected features to
a new shapefile and displayed the selected lakes

Set color of 1:10m land as #987db7, set opacity to 10%
Set color of 1:10m lakes and Michigan lake polygons as #08306B

Changed opacity of the shaded relief layer to 25%

Then for the rivers base flow data, under symbology I set to Graduated
and used Base Flow as the value. I used equal interval to divide the river
base flow into 10 categories. In QGIS I gave each category a different color,
I then in Adobe Illustrator later changed all of these lines to the same color
(#08306B) and set their stroke size to increase proportional with increasing
categories of flow size

Before exporting, layers were rganizaed in following order:
1) Michigan Lakes Polygons
2) Base Flow data of Michigan streams
3) Natural Earth 10m lakes shapefile
4) Michigan state shapefile
5) Natural Earth 10m land shapefile
6) shaded relief

Exported as PDF at 150dpi, then opened and copied data to new .ai file in Adobe Illustrator

In Illustrator, I changed the river colors and stroke sizes based on their flow,
also removed some small michigan lakes for visual clarity. Then added labels and text
