Project Goal
###########################################################

Goal was to make this for Film/TV prompt for MapPromptMonday
and this seemed an interesting topic I wanted to do


###########################################################
Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were three data sources I acquired:
1) World land polygons (shapefile)
2) Filming locations (.csv I created)
3) Images of movie scenes (image files)


1) World land polygons (shapefile)

Acquired 1:110m land polygons from Natural Earth Data at link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-physical-vectors/


2) Filming locations (.csv I created)

The information source I used for where scenes in the movie were filmed
or inspired by was this article:
https://www.atlasofwonders.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-filming-locations.html
Secondary reference:
http://movie-locations.com/movies/b/Blade-Runner-2049.php

I created a .csv file in Microsoft Excel with the filming locations or place
that inspired the filming on set. I then used the Google Geocoding API manual
interface (link below) to find latitude and longitude coordinates for these places

3) Images of movie scenes (image files)

I found screen shots of all scenes from the movie I would link to on my map. Where
I found each is listed below:

I also acquired a picture of the outside of Stelline Laboratories and took screenshot
of part of the building to use as fill coloring for land polygons in Adobe Illustrator

Data Visualization
###########################################################

I first opened the land polygons and film locations csv in QGIS,
displaying filming locations as points on top of land polygons

I changed outline (stroke) color of polygons to #7E9AA0

I then exported these layers as a PDF and opened the PDF in Adobe Illustrator
and copied the data to a new .ai file

Once in Adobe Illustrator, I loaded in and copied over the image of the Stelline
Laboratories exterior and used these with the land polygons to create clipping
masks so that the color/texture of the building was used for the polygons

I then changed the color of the points to one of three colors based on categorization:
#FF33CC (purple) - For scenes inspired by real world place
#FF6600 (orange) - For scenes shot on a constructed set
#00CCCC (cyan) - For scenes shot at real place

I then added the images of each scene and positioned and sized and cropped them
accordingly to be the same size and fit around the map data

I then used colored lines to connect between the images and the map points

I acquired and used a Blade Runner font for the title from here:
https://www.1001freefonts.com/blade-runner.font

The other font I used for explaining scene and context was Franklin Gothic Medium
