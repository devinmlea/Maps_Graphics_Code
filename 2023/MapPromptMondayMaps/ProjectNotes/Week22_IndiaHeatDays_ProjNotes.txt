Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to make this for my Climate Change Vulnerability entry for Map Prompt
Monday week 22 2023

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were two data sources I acquired:
1) May weather data from ogimet.com (.csv I created)
2) Natural Earth Data 1:50m countries polygons (shapefile)


1) May weather data from ogimet.com (.csv I created)

On the ogimet.com site, I searched India, which brought up all the weather stations
and data in India. I then went through each weather station, and if the station had either
0 or 1 day of missing data, I counted the number of days the maximum temperature was 35.0 C
or higher, and a second count of number of days max temperature was 40.0 C or higher. I also
used Google Geocoding API to plug in the location name and find latitude and longitude
coordinates for each place. These data were recorded in a .csv file.
* Given the format of the data provided, my counts actually only covered between May 2 to May 30,
so May 1 and May 31 are not included in the data
** To make sure all of India would be covered by the Kriging tool I used, I added a few dummy points
outside the country borders of India. You can view the data I used in the accompanying data
file ("Week22_IndiaHeatDays_Data.csv")

2) Natural Earth Data 1:50m countries polygons (shapefile)

I also used the following article as reference when producing my map and to add my
text describing the temperatures in May, based on similar heatwave in April:

Data Visualization

I first opened QGIS and loaded my .csv points and the world countries shapefile

I wanted to interpolate my points to create a continuous surface, and the best option
to me seemed to be Kriging. After searching around, I decided using the plugin called
Smart-Map would be my best option to do kriging. I initially learned about this resource
via this YouTube video:
"Interpolate points to rasters with kriging in QGIS using the Smart-Map plugin"
by Hans van der Kwast
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Vv1cAhiSVk

However, I realized that I would need my points to be in a UTM coordinate system so that
I could perform the kriging with this plugin. To quickly convert my lat,long points to
UTM coordinates using QGIS, I used the steps highlighted in this video:
"Convert Lat Lon to XY (UTM) using QGIS, Easy and Free"
by Theara.T
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_FeDXJ_NJY

I set my UTM coordinates based on WGS 84 / UTM zone 44N (EPSG: 32644), and then I just
restarted QGIS so I could get a blank document again and projected the new .csv file
and the countries shapefile using the UTM 44N projection.

Now with the UTM coordinates I could use the Smart-Map plugin. I started the plugin
and loaded in my data in the Data tab, with my number of days over 40C as the z value.
On the grid tab, I set pixel size to 5000 x 5000 meters. I generally left the values
on the interpolation tab as they were before running Interpolate to generate my raster,
values listed here:
Max Distance: 1868707.467
Lag: 102008.344
Model: Linear to Sill
Co: 4.663
Co + C: 73.294
A: 725992.328

Once I had created the interpolated surface, I changed the color ramp to the 'Reds' ramp
and made some unique adjustments using breaks listed below:
Position: 0%, opacity 0%
Position: 25%, #fdd1c0, opacity 67%
Position: 50%, #fb7050
Position: 75%, #d32020
Position: 100%, #67000d

For the countries shapefile I used the folowing symbology:
Fill color: #fffbfb
Stroke color: #232323
Stroke width: 0.04 mm

I then exported the map as a .pdf from QGIS at 1:20,000,000, then copied data from PDF
to a new .ai file in Adobe Illustrator.

In Adobe Illustrator I made a copy of the India polygon boundary, gave it a thicker stroke
width (0.6), then I created a clipping mask with the interpolated raster and the original
India polygon boundary to clip the interpolated surface to the shape of India.

I then took an image screen capture of the color ramp in QGIS and imported the image into
the .ai file and scaled it so I could use it for my map key. I then added appropriate
text.

To finish, I selected all country boundaries except India and gave them a slight Gaussian
Blur (2 pixels)
