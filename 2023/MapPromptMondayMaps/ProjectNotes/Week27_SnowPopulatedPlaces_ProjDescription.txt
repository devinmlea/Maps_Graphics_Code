Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to make this for my Snow or Ice entry for Map Prompt
Monday week 27 2023

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

Data sources I acquired:
1) Populated Places containing the word Snow (.csv I created)
2) Natural Earth Data 1:50m ocean (shapefile)
3) Natural Earth Data 1:50m land (shapefile)
4) Natural Earth Data 1:50m Admin 1 – States, provinces (shapefile)
5) Natural Earth Data 1:50m Admin lakes (shapefile)


1) Populated Places containing the word Snow (.csv I created)
Acqired names from the Geographic Names Information System
(https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis)
Clicking on "Search Domestic Names", I searched "Snow", not including
variants, and feature class = populated place. Of the results, I included
the place in my .csv file if its place name showed up on the map when I viewed
it, as some listed places seemed to be neighborhoods or streets that were not
equivalent to populated places. I also recorded the lat and long values of the
places that is also shown on the bottom corner of the map viewer.

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and added the four data layers. Layer order:
- Ocean (top)
- Snow Place Names Points from csv
- Lakes
- States/Provinces
- Land (bottom)

I first selected only the United States states from the States/Provinces layer
and saved the selection to a new layer and removed the States/Provinces layer

I then selected the Great Lakes from the Lakes layer and saved the selection
to a new layer and removed the full Lakes layer

Change colors using symbology to the following:
Ocean: fill color = #404046, no stroke
Snow Name Points: symbol = circle, fill color = #ffffff, size = 1.6mm, stroke color = #000000, stroke width = 0.4mm
Lakes: fill color = #404046, stroke = #f2f2f2, stroke width = 0.1mm
States: fill color = #191919, stroke = #f2f2f2, stroke width = 0.1mm
Land: fill color = #191919, no stroke

I then exported at scale 1:20,000,000 focused on contiguous United States and opened and copied
the exported PDF file data into a new Adobe Illustrator file.

The snowflake graphic I used to cover the snow name locations I obtained here:
https://pixabay.com/vectors/cold-snow-snowflake-weather-winter-147760/
I downloaded the vector graphic and opened and copied the graphic to my map file and then used
scale to size appropriately and made copies to cover all the locations.

I then labeled all place names. Font used was Open Sans. Used white 1pt lines for callouts where necessary.
Then provided other needed text and title. Title font was Segoe Print. The gradient colors
I used for the title are provided below. For information how to do this, follow this tutorial:
