Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to make this for my Plants entry for Map Prompt
Monday week 26 2023

Inspiration came from this news article:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/08/23/extinct-tree-species-sequoias/

Particularly, I was interesed in the statement in the article:
"And 17 at-risk species aren’t conserved in any botanic gardens or scientific collections"

So I found the original peer-reviewed article:
https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp3.10305
"Data sharing for conservation: A standardized checklist of US native tree species and threat assessments to prioritize and coordinate action"
(its open access)
and I found the most common of these 17 species were Hawthorn plants,
so I decided to make these the focus of my map

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

These were the data sources I acquired:
1) Natural Earth Data 1:50m countries polygons (shapefile)
2) Natural Earth Data 1:50m states/provinces (shapefile)
3) Natural Earth Data 1:50m lakes (TIF)
4) At-Risk Hawthorn species (.csv and .shp I created)


1) Natural Earth Data 1:50m countries polygons (shapefile)
Downloaded at this link:

Admin 0 – Countries

2) Natural Earth Data 1:50m states/provinces (shapefile)
Downloaded at this link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/
Admin 1 – States, provinces

3) Natural Earth Data 1:50m lakes (TIF)
Downloaded at this link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-physical-vectors/
Lakes + Reservoirs

4) At-Risk Hawthorn species (.csv and .shp I created)
Found the Hawthorn (Crataegus) species I needed in Table 6 from article here:
https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp3.10305
Then in QGIS I created approximate areas for each of the 8 species using
information I could find in the article and on the world wide web. See below:
Crataegus austromontana
ID 1 and 2

Crataegus florifera
ID 3 and 4
https://wisflora.herbarium.wisc.edu/taxa/index.php?taxon=3257

Crataegus lumaria
Id 5
https://wisflora.herbarium.wisc.edu/taxa/index.php?taxon=3266

ID 6 - combination of florifera, limaria, formosa

Crataegus ouachitensis
ID 7

Crataegus padifolia
ID8

Crataegus turnerorum
9

Crataegus wootoniana

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and added the four data layers. Layer order:
- Lakes (top)
- Hawthorn species areas polys
- States/Provinces
- Countries (bottom)

I first selected only the United States states from the States/Provinces layer
and saved the selection to a new layer and removed the States/Provinces layer

I then selected the Great Lakes from the Lakes layer and saved the selection
to a new layer and removed the full Lakes layer

Symbology was changed in QGIS as follows:
Countries layer:
fill color: #f7f7f9
stroke color: #232323
stroke width: 0.12mm

States layer:
fill color: #fafafb
stroke color: #232323
stroke width: 0.06mm

Great Lakes layer:
fill color: #ffffff
stroke color: #232323
stroke width: 0.06mm

I didn't change Hawthorn plants poly color as I would alter these in Adobe Illustrator

I then exported at 1:35,000,000 as PDF and opened and copied the data to a new file in Adobe Illustrator

For the Hawthorn plants colors I used the color scheme shown in Figure 7 here:
https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/

For each of the plant polygons I added an outer glow effect and gaussian blur effect to add
a bit of color and blurring around the edges since the areas were approximations

Added text. Title text is "Great Vibes" (free download on world wide web). Other text Open Sans (free download from Google)
