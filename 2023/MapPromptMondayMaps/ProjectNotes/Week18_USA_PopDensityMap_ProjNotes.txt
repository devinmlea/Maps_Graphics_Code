Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to make this for my Urban v. Rural entry for Map Prompt
Monday week 18 2023

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were four data sources I acquired:
1) State census tracts (shapefile)
2) US Nation 1:5m Cartographic Boundary File (shapefile)
3)
4) Census Tract population estimates (.csv)


1) State census tracts (shapefile)
Went to TIGER/Line Shapefiles page of US Census Bureau
https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php
Year selected was 2018, Layer Type was Census Tracts. After submitting
then selected each contiguous USA state and downloaded census tracts shapefile.

2) US Nation 1:5m Cartographic Boundary File (shapefile)
Obtained "cb_2018_us_nation_5m" from US Census Bureau at this link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html

3) US States 1:5m Cartographic Boundary File (shapefile)
Obtained "cb_2018_us_state_5m" from US Census Bureau at this link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html

4) Census Tract population estimates (.csv)
This 2018 data I had previously acquired from the US Census Bureau 2018 American
Community Survey. The population estimates and the census tract identifying codes
I saved in a .csv file that I would join to the state shapefiles to then calculate
population density.

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, I opened QGIS and loaded the state census tracts, national and states cbfs, and
usa census tract population estimates .csv

In order to show the population density for each census tract, for each state
census tracts shapefile I performed the following steps:

a) created new field named GEOID2 that was an integer data type
Then in field calculator used the expression:
GEOID2 - to_int("GEOID")
to update GEOID2 as integer values of GEOID

b) calculate new field, square km from ALAND in field calculator using expression:
"ALAND" / 1000000
This created a new field named "SQKM" (data type REAL, length 10, precision 2)

c) join attribute data from census tract population estimates .csv to state census tracts
joined using GEOID2 field in state census tracts shapefiles

d) Checked for 0 values of ALAND and removed these where applicable
0 ALAND value meant there was no land area (only water), so these census tracts were deleted

e) check edits for NULL values for population
I double checked the population estimates for any NULL values where there was not a match
between the .csv population estimates and census tract shapefiles once they were joined
and if there were any NULL values the census tracts were removed
(there were almost none of these across the 48 states)

f) calculated pop density in new field using field calculator and the expression:
"CT_Pop_AllUS_Pop" / "SQKM"
This created new field named "POPDEN" (data type REAL, length 10, precision 2)
that was population density per square kilometer

After completing these steps for the 48 contiguous USA states I then used the following
steps to display the population density for census tracts:

a) For each shapefile, under Properties -> Symbology, used Graduated symbology with value
"POPDEN". Then classified the data with 5 classes.

b) I then manually changed the classes so that the values would be by exponential of 10 as follows:
0.00 - 9.99 sq km 
10 - 99.99 sq km
100 - 999.99 sq km
1000 - 9999.99 sq km
10000 + sq km

c) I then slightly altered the color scheme for the five classes to be as follows:
0.00 - 9.99 sq km (#fffbfb)
10 - 99.99 sq km (#ffebeb)
100 - 999.99 sq km (#ff9999)
1000 - 9999.99 sq km (#ff5959)
10000 + sq km (#ff0000)

For the states cartographic boundary file I then made the fill transparent and the stroke width
0.02 mm. I also made fill transparent for the national cartographic boundary file and made its
stroke width 0.10 mm.

To finish, I exported the map from QGIS as a PDF, which I then copied into a new Adobe Illustrator
file and added text and a legend
