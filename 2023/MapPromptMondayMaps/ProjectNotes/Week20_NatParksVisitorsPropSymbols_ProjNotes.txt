Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my proportional symbols prompt for Map
Prompt Monday, and decided to do another US National Parks map after
looking around for data and finding 2022 visitors to each park

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were four data sources I acquired:
1) National Parks lat/long locations (.kmz file)
2) National Parks 2022 visitors (Wikipedia)
3) US Census Bureau 5m states Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)
4) Natural Earth 50m Gray Earth with Shaded Relief, Hypsography, and Ocean Bottom (Raster)
5) National Parks Service Logo (image)


1) National Parks lat/long locations (.kmz file)
Went to Wikipedia page with list of US National Parks
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States
At top of list there was option "Download coordinates as: KML"
Downloaded kml file with lat/long locations for National Parks

2) National Parks 2022 number of visitors (Wikipedia)
I acquired the number of visitors to each national park in 2022 from the following page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States
This data was originally released by the National Parks service, I compiled it into
my own .csv file

3) US Census Bureau 5m states Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)
Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

4) Natural Earth I with Shaded Relief and Water (Raster)
Downloaded from this link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-raster-data/10m-natural-earth-1/

5) National Parks Service Logo (image)
Downloaded the Twitter profile image of National Park Service

Data Visualization
###########################################################

I first took the downloaded image of the National Park Service Logo and opened
it in Microsoft Paint and used the eyedropper tool to sample colors from the
image. 

Original colors I sampled from image:
orange/brown: #c16c2c


I loaded the kml points layer, states boundary layer, and shaded relief raster into QGIS

Changed projection North America Lambert Conformal Conic (ESRI:102009)

For states boundary I set fill to fully transparent, stroke color: #f2f2f2, 0.12mm stroke width
Set points fill color to #c16c2c

Export as PDF at 1:24,000,000 and 200 dpi for continental United States
Export focused on Alaska at 1:24,000,000 and 200dpi, same projection
Zoomed to Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands and exported at 200dpi, same projection

Export focused on Hawai'i, changed projection to ESRI:102007, Scale 1:10,000,000 and 200 dpi
Same as Hawai'i when zoomed to American Samoa

In Adobe Illustrator once I assembled the map and the inset maps, I set all points to 70%
opacity and set point size based on number of 2022 visitors.
I calculated size based on a ratio between the number of visitors to Great Smoky Mountains
NP (12,937,633), which had the largest number of visitors in 2022, and the number of visitors for the
chosen park using ratio:
(Park # of visitors / 12,937,633) * 50 =  width and height in number of pixels
All sizes less than 2 were sized to width and height of 2 pixels
