Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my colorblind friendly map
for week 3 #MapPromptMonday 2023

I also wanted to see a visualization of where there are
paid sick leave and paid family leave laws in place in
the United States

Project Replication

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

I didn't use any GIS type of data for this map. I created my own hexmap of US
states, territories, and commonwealths because I didn't like how hexagons
were being warped by projections when using geospatial data.

However, the data I used for the map came from several sources, listed below:
https://www.lgbtmap.org/img/maps/citations-fmla-spouse.pdf
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-state-of-paid-sick-time-in-the-u-s-in-2023/
https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/state-paid-family-leave-laws-across-the-u-s/
https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/paid-leave-in-u-s/

In summary, all of these sources had been updated within the past year or so,
and I compiled them together and determined my various categories for the map
from these sources. States fell into one of six categories:
- Has no leave laws
- Has paid sick leave
- Has general personal paid leave law
- Has paid medical leave law
- Has paid family leave law
- Has paid sick leave and paid family leave laws

Data Visualization
###########################################################

In my hex template I start from I had font Franklin Gothic Medium Cond

I first had to decide how I wanted to color my data. Given I had six
qualitative categories and I wanted a colorblind friendly color palette,
I used Figure 1 (bright qualitative color scheme) from Paul Tol's website:
https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/

I used following colors for my categories:
gray: no laws
red: paid sick leave only
cyan: general personal leave
purple: paid medical leave only
green: paid family leave only
yellow: paid family leave and paid sick leave laws

Added remaining elements like key and relevant text
