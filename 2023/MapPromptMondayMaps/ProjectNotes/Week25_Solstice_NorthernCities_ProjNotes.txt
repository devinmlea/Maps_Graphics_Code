Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to make this for my Solstice/Seasons entry for Map Prompt
Monday week 25 2023


###########################################################
Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.


###########################################################
Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were five data sources I acquired:
1) Northernmost cities (.csv I created)
2) World Hillshade (ESRI data layer)
3) Natural Earth Data 1:10m countries polygons (shapefile)
4) Natural Earth Data 1:110m graticules, 20 degrees (shapefile)
5) Natural Earth Data 1:10m Natural Earth 1 Raster (TIF)
6) Time extents of sunlight hours (.csv I created)

1) Northernmost cities (.csv I created)
I initially planned to do northernmost capital cities, which can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_capitals_by_latitude
and sorted by latitude, but most were very close together so I wanted a map
with a little more diverse data, so I ended up going to this page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_northernmost_settlements
and acquiring lat/long data for northernmost cities with more than 250,000 inhabitants.
*I added Reykjavik in Iceland even though it doesn't meet this list because it
is the northernmost capital of a sovereign county as I nod to my initial idea
of northernmost capitals, a number of which also made the latter list.

2) World Hillshade (ESRI data layer)
When I opened QGIS I loaded this layer using Data Source Manager -> ArcGIS REST Server
Then used this link with the REST server
https://services.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Elevation/World_Hillshade/MapServer
When connected then I could load the world hillshade layer into my map

3) Natural Earth Data 1:10m countries polygons (shapefile)
Obtained from this link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/
Specifically, I went under section of Admin 0 â€“ Countries point-of-views
and downloaded the Ukraine version

4) Natural Earth Data 1:110m graticules, 20 degree intervals (shapefile)
Obtained from this link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-physical-vectors/

5) Natural Earth Data 1:10m Natural Earth 1 Raster (TIF)
Obtained from this link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-raster-data/10m-natural-earth-1/

6) Time extents of sunlight hours (.csv I created)
I was intially inspired in my design by a map with concentric circles showing the
extents of sun above horizon hours by Brian Brettschneider. I initially tried to
use equations I found on world wide web in Libre Office to calculate times based
on latitudes, but after not being satisfied that the results I was getting were correct
and searching I found and used solortopo.com:
http://www.solartopo.com/daylength.htm
How I used this is since you can click any location on Earth and it will provide you
with time sun is above horizon on your given day, I chose June 21, 2023 for date and
I clicked around map until I found the different hour time limits (23 hours, 22 hours,...)
down to 14 hour extent, and used that latitude with varying longitudes (every 1 degree)
in an OfficeLibre spreadsheet and saved as a .csv
So I started with a points layer, where each latitude also had an identifier which
I could use to make the points into lines

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and added the six data layers
I changed opacity of Natural Earth 1 Raster to 70% so I could get some
background affect of the World Hillshade behind it

I first used the Points to Path tool to create latitude lines that showed
the extents for each hour difference of sun above the horizon
To create individual lines for each latitude, I checked both the "Create closed
paths" and for both "Order expression" and "Path group expression" I used the
unique identifier for each latitude to group them.
After creating this layer I turned off the original points layer

I then changed projection to North Pole Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (ESRI 102017)
to focus map on North Pole and Arctic Circle

I then changed symbology of sun extent latitude lines, graticules, countries, and cities points

Sun extents latitude lines coloring:
Initially clicked on "effect neon" under defaults, then changed as below
Line: #26261e, 0.08mm stroke
Outer Glow color: #ffffe7, spread 1.5

Cities points:
Size: 2mm
Color: #232323
Stroke color: #ffffff
Stroke width: 0.4mm

graticules:
color: #ffffff
width: 0.05mm

countries:
fill: transparent
stroke color:#232323
stroke width: 0.08mm

Before export, from top to bottom, ordering of layers:
- Cities
- Sun extents by latitude
- Countries
- Graticules
- Natural Earth Raster
- World Hillshade

Exported from QGIS at 1:150,000,000 scale

Opened and copied to new .ai file in Adobe Illustrator

Over top of the imported data layers I created a number of circles with no fill,
stroke color 231f20, stroke width varied to be between the concentric circles of
the sun above horizon extents, and opacity varied to make it darker the further from
the center and less so as moved towards center.
In arctic circle itself I created a circle with fill color #ffffe7, stroke color of
b3b3a2, stroke width 0.3, opacity 70%

All text was Open Sans (you can acquire for free on World Wide Web)
All text color was #000000, for many text I used outer glow of color #ffffe7
to help differentiate from background
