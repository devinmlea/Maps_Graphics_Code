Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to create a grayscale map for Map Prompt Monday,
and I based many of the same steps of this map on the Day 21 (population)
map that I created for 30 Day Map Challenege 2022.

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were three data sources I acquired:
1) Kontur Data for the United States (geopackage)
2) Metropolitan/Micropolitan Statistical Areas (shapefile)
3) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile


1) Kontur Data for the United States 
Obtained Kontur Data for the United States here:
https://data.humdata.org/organization/kontur
Downloaded and unzipped to obtain geopackage file, then loaded in QGIS

2) Metropolitan/Micropolitan Statistical Areas (shapefile)
Obtained the file from link:
https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php
2021
Core Based Statistical Areas -> Metro/Micro Statistical Area
Downloaded, unzipped, loaded shapefile into QGIS

3) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, opened QGIS and loaded in the three data layers

I selected the following metropolitan and micropolitan areas:
Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue
Mount Vernon-Anacortes
Oak Harbor
Bremerton-Silverdale-Port Orchard
Shelton
Olympia-Lacey-Tumwater
using Select Features and then saved the selection to a new layer
using Export -> Save Selected Features As

I then dissolved these areas into a single polygon using the dissolve tool,
and then I edited the polygon and added a bit of area on the northwest side
of Puget Sound so all area directly around Puget Sound would incorporate population

I again used Select Features to select the Washington polygon from the
US States file and then saved the selection to a new layer using Export ->
Save Selected Features As

I then used clip to clip the Puget Sound Area file to the extent
of the Michigan Cartographic boundary layer

I then used Select By Location to select all of the hexagons in the Kontur
layer that intersected the clipped Puget Sound area layer, and again saved the
selection to a new layer using Export -> Save Selected Features As

Next I used the Rasterize (vector to raster) tool to convert the Puget Sound
area Kontur hexagons into a raster. Width/horizontal resolution set to 450.

The resulting raster had raster cells with no data, so to deal with this I used
the GRASS tool r.null in QGIS. Within this tool my inputs:
List of cell values to be set to NULL = -99999
The value to replace the null value by = 0.0
Raster Output name = PugetSndRasterNoNull
This replaced null values with 0s

Then used raster render, see more here:

http://www.statsmapsnpix.com/2020/11/how-to-make-3d-population-density.html

Then downloaded and opened Aerialod and loaded the raster that had been rendered.
Then rotated around until I found the angle I liked. I tried to play with colors
and lighting, but generally used the defaults. Saved output image of this using
screen shot.
Aerialod: https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=aerialod#:~:text=0.1),and%2016%2Dbit%20png%20images.

To create Washington Inset Map
-Obtained outline of WA by selecting from 1:5m state boundaries file
and saving to a new layer, then using white fill and black (R:35,G:35,B:35)
0.5 stroke width (white fill set to same as background color later in AI)
-Obtained Puget Sound area as described above by dissolving metro/micropolitan areas together
The Puget Sound area I created was layered on top of the Michigan boundary layer and was
colored gray (R:128,G:128,B:128) and stroke color was R:35,G:35,B:35 with width 0.2

I then loaded the screen shot image into Adobe Illustrator and copied the
image to a new .ai file. Then also loaded in, copied, and scaled the WA
inset map. Finally added text.
