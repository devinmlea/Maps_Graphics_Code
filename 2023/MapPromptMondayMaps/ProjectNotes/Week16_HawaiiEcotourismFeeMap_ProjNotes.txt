Inspiration for this map came from this NPR article:

Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to make a map for Environment prompt for
Map Prompt Monday. I read the relevant NPR article on Hawaii
considering an ecotourism law and was curious the extent of
lands that would be impacted.

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.


###########################################################
Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were four data sources I acquired:
1) 1:10m Natural Earth Data land polygons (shapefile)
2) 1:10m Natural Earth Data ocean bathymetry (shapefile)
3) Nature Reserves and Parks in Hawaii (shapefile)
4) Globe highlighting Hawaiian islands (QGIS)


1) 1:10m Natural Earth Data land polygons (shapefile)
I acquired land polygons at this link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/

2) 1:10m Natural Earth Data ocean bathymetry (shapefile)
I acquired ocean bathymetry at this link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-physical-vectors/

3) Nature Reserves and Parks in Hawaii (shapefile)
I first went to the Hawaii Statewide GIS Program geoportal here:
https://geoportal.hawaii.gov/
I searched for "Reserves", which produced a file produced by Division
of Forestry and Wildlife, Department of Land and Natural Resources
named "Reserves" that was described as having "various reserves, preserves,
parks, ect. in the State of Hawaii as of December 2022". I downloaded
this as a shapefile for my use.

4) Globe highlighting Hawaiian islands (QGIS)
I created the globe using the globe builder plugin in QGIS. I describe
more about this in the Data Visualization section below.


###########################################################
Data Visualization
###########################################################

I loaded the land polygons, ocean bathymetry polygons, and reserves polygons into QGIS

I changed the land polygons to almost white (#fafafa), no stroke outline

For the ocean bathymetry, I used the 0, 200, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 meter depths.
For each, here are the colors I assigned their fill (no stroke color):
0m depth: #3c6280
200m depth: #375a75
1000m depth: #32526b
2000m depth: #2d4b61
3000m depth: #284457
4000m depth: #233c4d
5000m depth: #1f3645

For the reserves polygons, under symbology I categorized the attribute data value by
the field 'managedby', which provided the state, local, federal, or private agency that
managed the land. I set all of land managed by a state agency to color #749964, all 
other lands I made fully transparent so they did not appear on the map.

I then exported the map from QGIS as a PDF at 1:3,500,000 scale and 150 dpi.
Opened and copied data to new .ai file in Adobe Illustrator.
I then added text (color: #fafafa) as needed.
Stats and background were from NPR article:
https://www.npr.org/2023/04/05/1168119111/hawaii-considers-fees-to-pay-for-ecotourism
Title and some of larger statistics text I used Georgia font type
For descriptive text I used Open Sans font type, which you can download free from Google:
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans

To get the inset map globe for my map, I opened a new QGIS file and used the Globe Builder
Plugin in QGIS to create a globe with near white (#fafafa) countries and no graticule and blue
(#86b4b4) background.  I exported the globe as an image and opened and copied and scaled the
image in my map. I had to manually edit the background color to fit to the globe extent.
