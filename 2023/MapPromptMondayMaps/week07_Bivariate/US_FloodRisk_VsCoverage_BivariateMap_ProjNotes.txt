Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to make this for my Bivariate Map entry for Map Prompt
Monday week 7 2023


###########################################################
Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

* NOTE: NFIP = National Flood Insurance Program

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were five data sources I acquired:
1) US Counties 1:5m Cartographic Boundary File (shapefile)
2) US States 1:5m Cartographic Boundary File (shapefile)
3) US Nation 1:5m Cartographic Boundary File (shapefile)
4) NFIP Insurance Coverage Data (.csv)
5) County-level flood hazard data (.csv)


1) US Counties 1:5m Cartographic Boundary File (shapefile)

Obtained "cb_2018_us_county_5m" from US Census Bureau at this link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html


2) US States 1:5m Cartographic Boundary File (shapefile)

Obtained "cb_2018_us_state_5m" from US Census Bureau at this link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html


3) US Nation 1:5m Cartographic Boundary File (shapefile)

Obtained "cb_2018_us_nation_5m" from US Census Bureau at this link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html


4) NFIP Insurance Coverage Data (.csv)

In mid-February 2023 when I obtained this data, the latest updated data were from November 30, 2022.
The data were found at this website:
https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/reports-flood-insurance-data
under "Policy Information by State", which provides you with an excel document broken down
by the number of policies in force at the time for each municipality that was part of the NFIP.
I took this data and saved it to a new .csv file.


5) County-level flood hazard data

These data were based from a 2018 Microsft data layer with all buildings in the United States
(updated data here: https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints) and 2018 flood hazard
maps produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for NFIP. Using these layers
in my doctoral dissertation I determined the number of building footprints in the Special
Flood Hazard Area (areas with 1% or greater chance of annual flooding based on historical data)
for all counties in United States with countywide map coverage. I used that data as part of
this map to determine difference between buildings to "high flood hazard" (i.e., buildings
that intersect the SFHA) and insurance coverage.

To prepare the NFIP Insurance coverage data and county-level flood hazard data to be used
in this map, I wrote an R script that aggregated the NFIP insurance coverage data to
the county level. The script then found all counties that had both flood hazard data
and insurance coverage data and combined these into a single .csv file.

In this new .csv file I sorted the data and assigned each county a variable based on
two categories:
1) number of buildings in the Special Flood Hazard Area
2) Percent Difference between buildings in SFHA and number of insurance policies

For each variable, a county was assigned to one of three categories:
For buildings in SFHA:
Assigned "1" if number of buildings in SFHA > 10,000
Assigned "2" if number of buildings was > 1,000 and < 10,000
Assigned "3" if number of buildings was < 1,000

For Pct Diff between buildings and polcies:
Assigned "A" if pct diff where polcies > SFHA buildings exceeded 5%
Assigned "B" if pct diff between policies and SFHA buildings was between 5% and -5%
Assigned "C" if pct diff where SFHA buildings > policies exceeded 5% (i.e., was less than -5%)

Based on these two categories, each county had one of 9 categories for the bivariate map:
A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,B3,C1,C2,C3

Data Visualization
###########################################################

To begin, I opened QGIS and loaded the US county, state, and national shapefile data, as
well as the combined flood hazard and insurance coverage data .csv

I joined the .csv to the counties shapefile attribute table using unique county FIPS code
id numbers.

I displayed the layers in this order (top to bottom):
- states
- counties
- nation boundaries

The states layer fill I made transparent and gave states stroke width of 0.08 mm
stroke color #232323

For counties layer, under symbology I sorted by "Categorized" data and had each
of the nine categories set as a different color:
A1 - #2dbbdf
A2 - #86cfdf
A3 - #bed8df
B1 - #333333
B2 - #999999
B3 - #e8e8e8
C1 - #e42e2e
C2 - #e48989
C3 - #e4c2c2
Stroke - 0.08, #323232
other values were set as white, no stroke

The colors I used were inspired by Joshua Stevens blog post about bivariate maps:
https://www.joshuastevens.net/cartography/make-a-bivariate-choropleth-map/

I initially started with the first (from left) of the provided color palettes under
the section "It's Dangerous To Go Alone! Take This", but I didn't like the colors
for my data, so I also used inspiration and kind of combined this intial palette with
the diverging and sequential scheme for bivariate maps by Cindy Brewer:
http://www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/ColorSch/Schemes.html

For the Nation layer I set fill as white and stroke width = 0.17 (color: #323232)

I then exported this map as PDF at 200dpi and copied the data to a new .ai file
in Adobe Illustrator.

In Illustrator, I just used the Rectangle tool to create the rectangles for the map
key, as well as adding all the text. Text font was Franklin Gothic Medium.
