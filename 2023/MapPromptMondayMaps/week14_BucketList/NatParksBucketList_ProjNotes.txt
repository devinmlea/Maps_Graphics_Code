Project Goal
###########################################################

One goal is to use this for my bucket list prompt for Map
Prompt Monday, and thought it would be fun to review what
US National Parks I have been to as well as the ones I haven't
been to but would most like to go to

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were four data sources I acquired:
1) National Parks lat/long locations (.kmz file)
2) US Census Bureau 5m states Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)
3) Natural Earth 50m Gray Earth with Shaded Relief, Hypsography, and Ocean Bottom (Raster)
4. National Parks Service Logo (image)


1) National Parks lat/long locations (.kmz file)
Went to Wikipedia page with list of US National Parks
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States
At top of list there was option "Download coordinates as: KML"
Downloaded kml file with lat/long locations for National Parks

2) US Census Bureau 5m states Cartographic Boundary shapefile (shapefile)
Downloaded Cartographic Boundary Shapefile from link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

3) Natural Earth 50m Gray Earth with Shaded Relief, Hypsography, and Ocean Bottom (Raster)
Downloaded from this link:
https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-raster-data/50m-gray-earth/

4) National Parks Service Logo (image)
Downloaded the Twitter profile image of National Park Service

Data Visualization
###########################################################

I first took the downloaded image of the National Park Service Logo and opened
it in Microsoft Paint and used the eyedropper tool to sample colors from the
image. 

Original colors I sampled from image:
orange/brown: #c16c2c
green: #374e20
However, I felt these colors were too dark based on the gray topography background,
so I ended up lightening them up. The final colors I used are here:
orange color NPS logo update - #d97731
green color NPS logo update: #638c3a

I loaded the kml points layer, states boundary layer, and shaded relief raster into QGIS

Changed projection North America Lambert Conformal Conic (ESRI:102009)

For states boundary I set fill to fully transparent, stroke color: #f2f2f2, 0.12mm stroke width
Changed shaded relief raster transparency to 85%
Set points fill color to #638c3a, stroke color to #333333, hairline stroke width

Export as PDF at 1:24,000,000 and 200 dpi for continental United States
Export focused on Alaska at 1:24,000,000 and 200dpi, same projection

Export focused on Hawai'i, changed projection to ESRI:102007, Scale 1:10,000,000 and 200 dpi
