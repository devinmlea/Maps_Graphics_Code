Project Goal
###########################################################

Primary goal was to create a map following Daniel Coe's tutorials
for creating Relative elevation models for rivers for the
"Inspired By" topic this week of Map Prompt Monday 2023

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep + Data Visualization
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data, as well as my visualization of the data.

I generally followed along with two tutorials on Daniel Coe's website:
1) https://dancoecarto.com/downloading-and-preparing-lidar-dems-for-rem-processing
2) https://dancoecarto.com/creating-rems-in-qgis-the-idw-method

The first link shows how to download LiDAR-derived 1m resolution DEMs from USGS.
The second link provides steps how to create Relative Elevation Models after
you have prepared your initial LiDAR data.


I followed the first link to prepare my LiDAR data from USGS, with a couple extra steps
based on my data.

Once I downloaded all the rasters I needed and merged them in my study area (confluence of
Little Snake River and Sand Creek in south Central Wyoming, USA), I found that the area
of my merged raster was much bigger than the actual study area I wanted and was a massive file
(approx 30 GB).
To focus on my study area and make a manageable raster size, I zoomed into the area of extent
I wanted for my new raster and used Clip Raster by Extent tool to clip to the area shown in the
view window. This decreased my raster to a manageable size (about 1GB). 

However, around the edges I had cells with values of 0, which were no data.
I used r.null to set 0 values to null in a new raster, so all the data values corresponded
correctly with elevation.

After this I generally followed the steps outlined by the IDW method link:
https://dancoecarto.com/creating-rems-in-qgis-the-idw-method
I followed these steps to create my Relative Elevation Model.

After creating the REM I played with various color schemes until I found one I liked
with a section of the study area that I think looked interesting.

I exported the map extent as a JPEG file format at 300 dpi and then opened the image
and copied to a new file in Adobe Illustrator. In Illustrator I added appropriate text
(font was EB Garamond) and when finished exported my .ai file as a JPEG file format.
