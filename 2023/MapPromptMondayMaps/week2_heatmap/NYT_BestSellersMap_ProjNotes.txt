Project Goal
###########################################################

First goal was to make map for 2023 week 2 Heat Map for
#MapPromptMonday

I also just thought this was an interesting topic since I
read quite a bit and I found the data on authors listed on
Wikipedia so I could easily use find out info on the authors
like where they were born

Project Replication
###########################################################

If you would like to replicate this project, I have detailed the software I used and
actions I performed in the sections below that you can follow to re-create my product.

Data Acquisition + Prep
###########################################################

This section describes the data acquired to create the map and any alterations
I made to the data. For information about displaying the map, see the Data
Visualization section.

There were two data sources I acquired:
1) NYT Fiction Best Sellers author information (wikipedia, created new .csv)
2) US Census Bureau states (shapefile)


1) NYT Fiction Best Sellers author information

For each week of years going back to 1932 on Wikipedia I found information on
book title and author of New York Times Fiction Best Sellers. For example, 2020:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Fiction_Best_Sellers_of_2020

I compiled all this information into a .csv file in Microsoft Excel and sorted
by author, then I used Wikipedia to find where each author was born. For the few
not listed on Wikipedia, I used Google search to try to find where authors were
born. I only had a small number (about 5) where I was unable to find a clear 
place of birth, so I didn't include these going forward.


2) US Census Bureau 5m States Cartographic Boundary Shapefile

I obtained 1:5m Cartographic Boundary Shapefile of state polygons from
US Census Bureau at:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
After downloading and unzipping the file, I opened the unzipped file in QGIS

Data Visualization
###########################################################

After finding locations where authors were born, I only included those in the United
States. Of the about 200 in the United States, I used Google Geocoder to find latitude
and longitude coordinates for each city location.

Once I had the .csv with each author and lat/long of their birth location, I loaded
the .csv file in to display these coordinates together with the US State polygons
shapefile.

For the points, I then used some of the steps in this guide below to generate a heat
map from my birth location points:

I wanted to emulate like the map was book or newspaper print, so I made the darkest
color (densest points) black, and lightest color a gray with slight yellow tint.

I then exported this map from QGIS and added text in Adobe Illustrator
For Fonts, most of the text I used Helvetica since that is one of the primary
fonts used by New York Times. For "The New York Times" to emulate its style
I found on a website and downloaded the English Towne - normal font to create
the iconic new york times title font style.
